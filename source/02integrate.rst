Getting started
===============

Integrate Unity SDK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add iOS dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add Android dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Final setup
^^^^^^^^^^^

Please remember that in Unity, click events are not triggered at all unless there is an EventSystem UI object.
If this doesn't exist in the Hierarchy, add one from the **GameObject > UI** menu.

Also, since the Unity SDK uses the iOS / Android native SDK, testing your app in Unity won't show ads. Only by playing the app on a simulator
or device will the whole ad process be triggered.
