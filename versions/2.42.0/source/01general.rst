The SuperAwesome Kids Web Services (KWS) Social SDKs for Mobile are a set of
individual composable components for easily creating kid-safe social
applications for the Android platform.

They may be used in isolation to each other or composed together to
create a complete social media experience for kids.

The SDKs are backed by `SuperAwesome <https://www.superawesome.com/>`_â€™s
`Kids Web Services <https://www.superawesome.com/kws-kids-web-services>`_
platform, which provide APIs for authentication, content creation,
content moderation, social actions (such as like, share, follow),
and personalised social content feeds.

The SDKs are written in native `Kotlin <https://kotlinlang.org/>`_ and use the
`Redux <https://redux.js.org/>`_ patterns internally.

The SDK is split up in components.
Each component is created so as to work alone or combined with other components
as well as custom application side code.

Each component is supports skinning via XML layouts.

Each component is described in detail below.
