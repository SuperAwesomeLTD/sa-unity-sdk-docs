Measure installs
================

The AwesomeAds SDK contains a submodule that allows you to measure installs generated by CPI (Cost per Install) campaigns.

The submodule is already integrated in the main SDK.

If you build for Android, make sure the following receiver is registered in your ApplicationManifest.xml file
(and it should be automatically added by the SuperAwesome SDK when you build to Android):

.. code-block:: shell

    <receiver android:name="tv.superawesome.lib.sacpi.SACPI"
              android:exported="false"
              android:permission="tv.superawesome.sdk.SuperAwesomeSDK">
              <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER"/>
              </intent-filter>
   </receiver>

Once you've done that you'll need to call the **handleInstall** method, preferably in the first scene presented to the user.

.. code-block:: c#

    public class MainScript : MonoBehaviour {

        void Start () {
          SACPI.getInstance ().handleInstall ((success) => {
            // handle callback
          });
        }

        // Update is called once per frame
        void Update () {
            // ...
        }
    }

The method will only run once per application lifecycle, usually when the application is first installed on a user's phone.

It also contains a simple callback with a boolean **success** parameter that lets you know if AwesomeAds considered this
install as having been generated by a CPI campaign.

.. warning:: Please be aware that not implementing this method at all will mean you won't be able to measure installs coming from
             AwesomeAds CPI campaigns, at all.
