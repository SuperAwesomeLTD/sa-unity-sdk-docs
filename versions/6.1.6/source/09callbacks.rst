Ad callbacks
============

Banner ads, interstitials and video ads all send a number of callbacks to inform you of important lifecycle events.

.. code-block:: c#

    SAVideoAd.setCallback ((placementId, evt) => {
        switch (evt) {

        case SAEvent.adLoaded:
        // called when an ad has finished loading
        break;

        case SAEvent.adEmpty:
        // called when the request was successful but the server returned no ad
        break;

        case SAEvent.adFailedToLoad:
        // called when an ad could not be loaded
        break;

        case SAEvent.adShown:
        // called when an ad is first shown
        break;

        case SAEvent.adFailedToShow:
        // called when an ad fails to show
        break;

        case SAEvent.adClicked:
        // called when an ad is clicked
        break;

        case SAEvent.adEnded:
        // called when a video ad has ended playing (but hasn't yet closed)
        break;

        case SAEvent.adClosed:
        // called when a fullscreen ad is closed
        break;
        }
    });
